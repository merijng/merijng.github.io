Tired of the monthly fees for music streaming services like Spotify Premium, but still want to listen to your favorite songs without interruptions? There's a smart and completely legal way to get a similar premium experience, and it's entirely free. All you need is the Brave browser and a YouTube account.

In this guide, we'll explain how you can use this combination to enjoy YouTube Music without annoying ads.

## Why This Method Works: The Power of Brave

The secret behind this method is the **Brave browser**. Brave is a web browser built with a focus on privacy and security. One of its key features is the built-in ad and tracker blocker, called **Brave Shields**.

This blocker does exactly what its name suggests: it automatically blocks ads and trackers on the websites you visit. This also applies to the audio and video ads on YouTube and YouTube Music.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Listen to Music for Free in 4 Steps

Setting it up is surprisingly simple and only takes a few minutes.

### Step 1: Install the Brave Browser

If you're not already using Brave, now is the time to start.

1.  Go to the official website: [brave.com](https://brave.com).
2.  Download and install the browser.

Brave works just like Chrome or Firefox, so switching is easy. You can even import your bookmarks and extensions.

### Step 2: Go to YouTube Music

Open the newly installed Brave browser and navigate to YouTube Music.

*   **Website:** [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com)

Log in with your standard Google or YouTube account. You don't need a special subscription.

### Step 3 (Optional): Add to Your Home Screen

For an app-like experience, you can place a shortcut to YouTube Music on your device. This makes opening it as easy as a regular app.

*   **On desktop:**
    1.  Click the icon on the right side of the address bar (usually a screen with an arrow).
    2.  Confirm the installation. YouTube Music will now appear as an app in its own window.

*   **On Android:**
    1.  Tap the menu icon (three dots).
    2.  Select **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"**.
    3.  Confirm the installation. The shortcut will now appear on your home screen.

### Step 4: Enjoy Uninterrupted Music

That's it! Find your favorite artists, albums, or playlists and start listening. You'll notice that the ads that normally play between songs are completely gone. Brave Shields blocks them in the background, giving you a seamless listening experience.

## Advantages of This Approach

*   **Completely free:** No monthly subscription fees.
*   **No ads:** Enjoy music without interruptions.
*   **Huge music library:** Access to the gigantic catalog of YouTube Music.
*   **Enhanced privacy:** Brave not only blocks ads but also online trackers that monitor your browsing behavior.
*   **Works on desktop and mobile:** This method works great on your computer and also in the mobile Brave app for Android.

## Are There Any Downsides?

While this is a fantastic alternative, there are a few Spotify Premium features you'll miss:

*   **Offline downloads:** You can't download music for offline use without a YouTube Premium subscription.
*   **Audio quality:** The default audio quality on YouTube Music is good, but audiophiles might prefer the higher bitrate options of paid services.
*   **Limited background playback on iOS:** As mentioned, on an iPhone or iPad, the music stops if you leave the Brave app or lock the screen. This is a limitation of Apple's operating system, not Brave. Background playback does work on Android.

## Conclusion

For anyone who primarily listens to music on a computer or Android phone and doesn't need offline downloads, the combination of Brave and YouTube Music is the perfect free alternative to Spotify Premium. You'll save money, protect your privacy, and enjoy an uninterrupted stream of your favorite music. Try it for yourself!
